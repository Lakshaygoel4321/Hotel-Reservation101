# **Hotel Reservation Prediction** 🏨🚀  

This repository presents a **machine learning pipeline** designed to predict hotel reservations efficiently. The project follows best MLOps practices, ensuring robust data ingestion, model training, and deployment on a **local server** (without CI/CD).  

---

## 🛠 **Tools & Technologies**  
This project utilizes:  
- **Python**: Core programming language  
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing reservations  
- **Pandas & NumPy**: Data processing and manipulation  
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning model development  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization  
- **Flask**: Web framework for local deployment  

---

## 📊 **Dataset**  
The project uses a dataset containing hotel booking details, including customer preferences, booking dates, cancellation status, and stay duration.  

📥 **[Download Dataset](#)** (Replace with actual dataset link)

## ⚙️ **Project Workflow**  
The machine learning pipeline consists of the following steps:  
1️⃣ **Data Collection & Storage** – Load hotel reservation data into MongoDB.  
2️⃣ **Data Preprocessing** – Handle missing values, feature encoding, and transformation.  
3️⃣ **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Gain insights through data visualization.  
4️⃣ **Model Training** – Train predictive models for reservation status.  
5️⃣ **Model Evaluation** – Assess model performance using relevant metrics.  
6️⃣ **Local Deployment** – Host the trained model on a Flask-based web app.
